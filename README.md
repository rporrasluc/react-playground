# react-playground
A project for tracking my progress learning React.

## Getting started
First place to go when learning React is [React official page](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html). 

Based in their recommendations we have downloaded the starter pack and created our helloworld. A 2 minutes example which shows us how easy is to render our first view using React.

Thanks to this small piece of code I have learnt a bit about the [JSX syntax](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and included Babel to perform the transformation in the browser.

In the first chapter we will see how React can be used together with package managers.
